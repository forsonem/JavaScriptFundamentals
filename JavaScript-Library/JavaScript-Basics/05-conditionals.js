//Sample Code
//1
var isOn = true;

//2   //3
if(isOn === true) {
    console.log("The light is on."); //4
}

//Short hand version
var isOn = true;
    //1
if(isOn) { // same as if (isOn === true) 
    console.log("The light is on. It's bright.");
}
//Second Example
var weather = 75;

if(weather > 70){
    console.log("Wear shorts today! It's going to be hot!");
}
