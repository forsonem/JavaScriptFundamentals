//We can assign a permanent value to a variable with const (short for constant). If you create a variable with const, you can NOT change the value. Consider the following:
const feetInMile = 5280; // There are always 5,280 feet in a mile. 
console.log(feetInMile);
feetInMile = 5300; // This will cause an error. Try running these 3 lines of code.
//Naming
//We can name variables almost anything
var ageOfMyOldestFerret = 40;
var numberOfEggsInOneSitting = 50;
//Variable names should be descriptive. For example, if you needed a variable to store a first name, the following would work well:
var firstName = "Jon";

//Camel Casing
var numberOfGrammysIHaveWon = 0; 
var myBirthYear = 1976;
var newNumber = 1 * numberOfGrammysIHaveWon;

//Practice
var age = 40;
var ageInAugust = age + 1;  
console.log(ageInAugust);//What will you get here?

var eleven = 11;
console.log(eleven * eleven); //What will the answer be?

var nineteen = 19;
console.log(age - nineteen); //What will the answer be?

//Reserved Words:
//The following is list of JavaScript reserved words, and they should never be used as variable names:

//abstract
//boolean
//break
//case
//catch
//char 
//class
//const
//continue
//debugger
//default
//delete
//do
//double
